 IF I AM NOT FOR MYSELF, WHO WILL BE?
 BUT IF I AM ONLY FOR MYSELF, WHAT AM I?
 THOUGH A SEEKER SINCE MY BIRTH,
 HERE IS ALL I'VE LEARNED ON EARTH,
 THIS IS THE GIST OF WHAT I KNOW:
 GIVE ADVICE AND BUY A FOE.

 PRESSED FOR RULES AND VERITIES,
 ALL I RECOLLECT ARE THESE:
 FEED A COLD TO STARVE A FEVER,
 ARGUE WITH NO TRUE-BELIEVER.
 THINK-TOO-LONG IS NEVER-ACT,
 SCRATCH A MYTH AND FIND A FACT.

 STITCH IN TIME SAVES TWENTY STITCHES,
 GIVE THE RICH TO PLEASE THEM, RICHES.
 GIVE TO LOVE YOU HEARTH AND HALL,
 BUT DO NOT GIVE ADVICE AT ALL.
