 NOBODY LOSES ALL THE TIME
 I HAD AN UNCLE NAMED
 SOL WHO WAS A BORN FAILURE AND
 NEARLY EVERYBODY SAID HE SHOULD HAVE GONE
 INTO VAUDEVILLE PERHAPS BECAUSE MY UNCLE SOL COULD
 SING MCCANN HE WAS A DIVER ON XMAS EVE LIKE HELL ITSELF WHICH
 MAY OR MAY NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT MY UNCLE
 SOL INDULGED IN THAT POSSIBLY MOST INEXCUSABLE
 OF ALL TO USE A HIGHFALOOTIN PHRASE
 LUXURIES THAT IS OR TO
 WIT FARMING AND BE
 IT NEEDLESSLY
 ADDED
 MY UNCLE SOL'S FARM
 FAILED BECAUSE THE CHICKENS
 ATE THE VEGETABLES SO
 MY UNCLE SOL HAD A
 CHICKEN FARM TILL THE
 SKUNKS ATE THE CHICKENS WHEN 
 MY UNCLE SOL
 HAD A SKUNK FARM BUT
 THE SKUNKS CAUGHT COLD AND
 DIED AND SO
 MY UNCLE SOL IMITATED THE
 SKUNKS IN A SUBTLE MANNER
 OR BY DROWNING HIMSELF IN THE WATERTANK
 BUT SOMEBODY WHO'D GIVEN MY UNCLE SOL A VICTOR
 VICTROLA AND RECORDS WHILE HE LIVED PRESENTED TO
 HIM UPON THE AUSPICIOUS OCCASION OF HIS DECEASE A
 SCRUMPTIOUS NOT TO MENTION SPLENDIFEROUS FUNERAL WITH
 TALL BOYS IN BLACK GLOVES AND FLOWERS AND EVERYTHING AND
 I REMEMBER WE ALL CRIED LIKE THE MISSOURI
 WHEN MY UNCLE SOL'S COFFIN LURCHED BECAUSE
 SOMEBODY PRESSED A BUTTON
 (AND DOWN WENT
 MY UNCLE
 SOL
 AND STARTED A WORM FARM)
