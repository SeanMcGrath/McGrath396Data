 I WOULD TAKE COUNSEL OF MYSELF.
 I WOULD STOP AND LOOK WITHIN
 AND LOOKING WITHIN, LOOK BACK, ALSO
 THAT I MAY LOOK AHEAD WITH CLEARER UNDERSTANDING
 OF THE WAY I HAVE BEEN MOVING, AND IN WHAT DIRECTION.
 I NEED TO KNOW IF I AM GOING FORWARD OR RETREATING,
 WHETHER I HAVE BEEN WASTING, OR ENJOYING
 THE PRECIOUS MOMENTS OF LIFE.  THERE HAVE BEEN FRICTIONS,
 ANNOYANCES AND SOMETIMES WRATH,
 BUT WERE THEY BECAUSE I WAS RIGHT AND OTHERS WRONG.....
 HAVE I HAD MY THOUGHTS TOO SHARPLY FOCUSED
 ON THAT WHICH PLEASED ME, SERVED MY SELF-ESTEEM,
 UNDERGIRDED MY SECURITY,
 OF WHICH I DID NOT INQUIRE WHETHER IT SERVED OR HAMPERED OTHERS.....
 HAVE I BEEN TRYING TO STOP THE CLOCK
 TO HOLD THE WORLD
 IN PERPETUATION OF WHAT WAS AN IS ALREADY SLIPPING AWAY.....
 HAVE I BEEN CRITICAL OF OTHERS FOR WHAT REALLY NEEDED CHANGING IN ME...
 LET ME INDEED TAKE COUNSEL OF MYSELF
 AND SET MY DIRECTIONS STRAIGHT.
