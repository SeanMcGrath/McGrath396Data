 THERE IS AN OLD, OLD RECIPE IN MAINE FOR STEWING COOT. PLACE THE
 BIRD IN A KETTLE OF WATER WITH A RED BUILDING BRICK FREE OF MORTAR AND
 BLEMISHES. PARBOIL THE COOT AND BRICK TOGETHER FOR THREE HOURS.
 POUR OFF THE WATER, REFILL THE KETTLE, AND AGAIN PARBOIL FOR THREE HOURS.
 ONCE AGAIN POUR OFF THE WATER, FOR THE LAST TIME ADD FRESH WATER,
 AND LET THE COOT AND BRICK SIMMER TOGETHER OVERNIGHT. IN THE MORNING,
 THROW AWAY THE COOT AND EAT THE BRICK.
